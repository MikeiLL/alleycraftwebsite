A customer gave me an old photo and asked that the family heirloom be recreated for her new granddaughter in California.

The lumber we used was pieces of a tree the client’s father had cut back in the 1960’s.

One difference was that the new crib would have three times as many spindles to meet modern safety guidelines.
