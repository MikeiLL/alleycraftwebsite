Architectural Millwork Specialist, David Alley founded David Alley Carpentry in 2003, working with local designers, decorators &amp; architects or directly with customers in building custom kitchens, living and dining rooms, bathrooms and more for dozens of local businesses and homeowners.

Born in Sunnyvale, CA in1964, the family moved briefly to Kansas, then to his current home-city, Pensacola when David was six years old. They ended up in Corpus Christi, TX, where David spent the rest of his formative years and at the age of seventeen apprenticed under Gary Males &amp; Paul Brooks at Aris Design – their first helper. In his twenties he spent some time doing framing and on-site cabinet building where he learned the art of scribing (transferring odd shapes and wavy walls to the cabinetry). He also married his life-partner, Amy and her young son, Elliot.

Together they moved back to David’s childhood city of Pensacola in 1993, where David worked as a foreman with Seaborn Woodworking as a cabinet-maker for five years, including design and installation in the well known Barnhills and Cooker restaurants, as well as residential work. David then traveled a bit, spending a year with American Stairs, opening their Cabinet Department and designing the cabinetry for the Ethan Allen Store in Palm City, FL, after which, with Andy Bland Construction he helped to build a Bass Pro Shop, which included work with carved logs, and installed Carnish (Crown Molding made of fiberglass) at the top of large buildings. With [Ambienti](http://www.ambientiusa.com) architectural millwork company out of Jacksonville, TX, David installed all of the cabinetry (armoire, desk and headboard) in the suites and rooms at the Don Cesar Hotel in St. Petersburg as well as building custom pieces in Ambienti’s architectural millwork facility.

Finding work again in Pensacola, David spent a year with Craftsman Architectural Millwork Company, doing all of the cabinetry in Sacred Heart Hospital, before setting out on his own with David Alley Carpentry. He continues to keep busy with carpentry &amp; design work, grandchildren, boating, gardening, community involvement and theater.
